# Big files preprocessing 

Working with neural networks, I've faced with a problem of gathering and preprocessing large data 
bunches, which are necessary for object detection and classification models, so here are some codes,
which may make work with data more easy and fast:

 - "cut_from_video" - if you've got a detection model and you want to gather image-data from any video,
you may use it to detect available objects, cut them from frame and paste into directory.
